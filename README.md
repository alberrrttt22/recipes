# recipes

A very simple project made using basic HTML to solidify knowledge of anchor tags (for links), img tags, lists and some general HTML syntax. EZ recipes as they're recipes I actually see myself doing so I can refer back to this.

Learnt how important project planning is before actually starting the project.
